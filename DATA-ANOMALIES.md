# Data Anomalies & Known Limitations

Honest catalog of every known gap, quirk, and caveat in this dataset. Nothing here is a secret failure — each item is either an intrinsic property of the source documents, a documented deferral, or a tracked open task. If you're about to draw a conclusion from this data, read the relevant entry first.

**Generated:** 2026-07-08. See also [`DATA-DICTIONARY.md`](DATA-DICTIONARY.md) (schemas) and [`code/PARSING.md`](code/PARSING.md) (per-year parse status).

## 1. Blocked source documents — not machine-readable → tracked in [#4](https://github.com/BetaNYC/New-York-City-Budget/issues/4)

These sources cannot be parsed by the repo's deterministic text-layer extractors and were **left unparsed rather than guessed** (the repo forbids hand transcription / LLM number-reading). They need an OCR/conversion pass — **open GitHub task [#4](https://github.com/BetaNYC/New-York-City-Budget/issues/4)**.

| Fiscal Year | Document | Why blocked |
|---|---|---|
| FY2009 | Transparency Resolutions — 8 PDFs (`source/FY09/transparency-resolutions/`) | Scanned images, no text layer |
| FY2012 | `source/FY12/fy2012-changestobudget.pdf` (Capital §254) | JBIG2 scan, no text layer |
| FY2013 | Transparency Resolutions 07, 10, 11 (`source/FY13/transparency-resolutions/*.doc`) | Legacy Word `.doc` binary, not a PDF |

## 2. FY2009–FY2014 have no organization/EIN detail → tracked in [#5](https://github.com/BetaNYC/New-York-City-Budget/issues/5)

Schedule C for **FY2009–FY2014 is initiatives-level only** (category/initiative totals). There are **no per-organization award rows and no EINs**. This is intrinsic: pre-FY2016, designations were largely made *after* adoption, so organization detail lives in the Transparency Resolutions, not the adopted Schedule C. FY2016 is the first year the adopted Schedule C carries award/EIN tables.

**Consequence:** EIN-keyed analysis — and the budget MCP's award tools — are valid **FY2016 onward only**. Reconstructing the earlier years from Transparency Resolutions + NYC Open Data is **open GitHub task [#5](https://github.com/BetaNYC/New-York-City-Budget/issues/5)**.

## 3. Low text-confidence for FY2010–FY2013 organization/program names

For FY2010–FY2013 Transparency Resolutions, the **financial columns (EIN, amount, agency, date, action) are reliable**, but the **`organization` / `member` / `program` *text* is low-confidence** — that era's PDFs have a glued text layer that runs adjacent fields together. Each affected `*_reconciliation.txt` self-reports a HIGH / MODERATE / LOW org-text confidence band. Use the EIN, not the name, as the identity key for these years.

## 4. Non-exact Schedule C reconciliation is (usually) the *source's* arithmetic

Some Schedule C years reconcile at, e.g., 24/26 or 21/22 categories rather than N/N. In the cases checked, the miss is an **in-source arithmetic inconsistency** — the PDF's own listed line items don't sum to its own printed category TOTAL. The parser faithfully captures both; they disagree in the document. This is the same class already documented for FY2025–FY2027. It is a property of the City's PDFs, not an extraction error — but each such case should be spot-verifiable against the source, and the `*_reconciliation.txt` shows the exact delta.

## 5. Deferred parses — parsed elsewhere-incomplete, not shipped wrong

| Item | Status | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| **FY2015 Schedule C** | Being addressed via a dedicated `parse_schedule_c_fy15.py` | Its 28 ToC categories vs 24 summary blocks break the *shared* parser's positional mapping; fixing it in the shared parser risked regressing the good FY2016–FY2027 years. A standalone FY2015 parser avoids that. (Update this entry when it lands.) |
| **Capital ResoA, FY2017 & FY2021** | Parsed but **not committed** | Use FY2025-tuned column coordinates and have **no printed subtotals to verify against** — unverifiable, so withheld rather than shipped unchecked. FY2022–2024 ResoA are redundant (their reconcilable Supporting Detail Book is committed instead). |
| **FY2019 Capital** | Not committed | Older capital sub-format with no subtotals to reconcile. |
| **FY2008 Schedule C** | Untouched | Earliest-era format; not yet attempted. (FY2008 is also the confirmed floor — nothing published before it.) |

## 6. Transparency files embed prior-year rows — filter on the column, not the filename

A `{year}_transparency_all.csv` (e.g. `fy26_transparency_all.csv`) contains rows whose `fiscal_year` column spans **several prior years**, not just the filename year — because a given year's resolutions designate money against multiple open fiscal years. **Always filter on the `fiscal_year` column**, never assume the filename bounds the contents. This is expected behavior, not corruption.

## 7. Capital `sub_id` does not join to spending data

The §254 capital `sub_id` is an internal budget-line sub-project identifier. There is **no clean key** from it into NYC Checkbook's `contract_id` / spending records — a structural gap in the City's own data, not something this repo can bridge. Tracing a capital project from adoption to actual payment requires fuzzy matching (agency + amount + date), which this repo does not attempt.

## 8. FY2012 duplicated Transparency Resolution source

FY2012 shipped a duplicated source PDF (a `-dup` file). Confirm the parsed output did not double-count those rows (the data-QA validator checks for duplicate rows — see `data/QA-REPORT.md`).

## 9. Transparency Resolutions not yet parsed for FY2025 / FY2027

FY2025's Transparency Resolution source PDFs are present in `source/FY25/` but not yet parsed into `data/`. FY2027's do not exist yet (the fiscal year is too early in its cycle). FY2026 is fully parsed (and embeds prior-year rows per #6).
